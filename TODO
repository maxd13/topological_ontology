Prove the following theorems:
   ☐ `Conjunctive_1'` + PSR + Zorn -> PP for substrata (reifying chains).
      In a world w, take a substrata x which has a cause, and consider the partial
      order under causation of all the events which cause x in w; because x is a substrata, these events
      must occur in w. Then apply Zorn's lemma and take a chain of events in this partial order,
      and we can then proceed by cases.
      1. If the chain only has a single contingent element, then trivially it has an upper bound.
      2. If the chain has more than one contingent element, then the conjunction of the whole chain, 
         must be a contingent event, since the chain occurs at least in w, but in at least
         some other world one some event in the chain doesn't occur, and hence the chain doesn't occur.
      3. Therefore, by the PSR, this event has a cause c.
      4. Therefore also by `Conjunctive_1` this cause c needs to be a cause also of any contingent event
         in the chain, since the chain event can be expressed as the conjunction of itself with any
         contingent event in the chain.
      5. Then if the chain only contains contingent elements, c is an upper bound of the chain.
      6. But if the chain contains a necessary element, then either this is the greatest element of the
         chain or not.
      7. But if it is the greatest element of the chain, it is an upper bound of the chain.
      8. And if it is in the middle of the chain, then it has some cause y in the chain which is contingent.
      9. But then because c is the cause of all contingent events in the chain, it must be the cause of y,
         and hence, by transitivity, it must also be the cause of the necessary element. Hence c is an
         upper bound of the whole chain.
      This concludes the proof.
